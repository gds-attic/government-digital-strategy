##06 Developing digital transactions

Transactional services are the primary focus of this strategy. This is
because developing transactional services offers the greatest scope to
improve efficiency and the customer experience. A focus on developing these makes an important contribution to the government's [Open Public Services agenda](http://files.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/HMG_OpenPublicServices_web.pdf), supporting increased personalisation and choice within public services. And despite the progress
outlined above, they are also the area where there is the most work to
be done to improve the digital offer and increase user take-up.

There is [a huge volume of transactions with government](http://transactionalservices.alphagov.co.uk/). 
There were around 1 billion individual transactions a year with central government
departments in 2011/12. This number rises to nearer 1.5 billion when
other governmental organisations such as local government are taken into
account.

These transactions are not evenly spread across departments, with just
7 responsible for around 90% of the central government transactions.
These are HMRC, DfT, DWP, BIS, DEFRA, MoJ, and the Home Office.

Whilst the majority of transactions are between government and
individuals, there are also a significant number of transactions between
government and business. This includes some which are very complex and
high value (for example farming payments). In these cases, the use of
specialist third-party intermediary organisations is common. The process
improvements recommended in this strategy will support these
arrangements.

###What is preventing people from using digital transactions?

Most government transactions fall far short of the standard of the best.
Unlike successful digital services in the private sector, government’s
online services are not necessarily better or more convenient than other
channels, meaning they will not be users’ first choice to transact with
us.

For example, in some circumstances it is quicker to apply for some
services by phone than by using the existing online service. In 2011,
around 150 million calls a year coming into government [were
self-reported as avoidable](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/freedom-information-contact-centre-benchmarking-data). Such failure is frustrating and
time-consuming for users but it is also costly for government. If users
have to revert back to other channels, then meeting this additional ‘failure demand’
is an unnecessary additional cost.

There are several causes of these failures. Many government services
rely on digitised versions of pre-digital business processes, layered on
top of legacy IT systems, some of which are over 30 years old. They were not
designed with a digital service in mind, being built to replicate paper
forms and processes rather than taking advantage of opportunities to
pre-populate or respond to user’s selections. They have outdated back-end systems that prevent effective data sharing, and/or they have
long-term contracts locked into expensive vendors making changes to
services costly and slow.

Each service has often been designed individually, rather than
developing a consistent approach to user experience across the
government digital estate. Hence the user experience of government
transactions is inconsistent and unnecessarily confusing, particularly
to less confident users.

Leading private sector digital businesses have learned that familiarity
drives usage, and usage drives familiarity. This lack of a consistent,
high-quality user experience is a critical issue holding back
performance and adoption of our digital services.

Despite evidence of growing use of mobile devices as the route into
digital channels, only a handful of government digital services cater
fully for the needs of mobile internet users. Very few government
digital services are flexible or agile enough to keep up with the rapid
changes in user behaviour typified by the growth of the mobile sector.
If existing lengthy procurement processes and inflexible development
models continue, they will be similarly poorly placed to adapt at any
pace to future changes in how people prefer to use the internet.

The [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform) acknowledges that we need to develop the
right capability and skills to design, communicate and deliver the
high-quality digital services we require. This digital strategy aligns
with the Civil Service Capabilities Plan; both will be woven into
departments’ own strategic planning, including their new improvement
plans.

There has been an over-reliance on a handful of large systems
integrators, [referred to by the Public Administration Select Committee
(PASC) as an ‘oligopoly'](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/report-on-Government-it-published/). As a result, the civil service does not have
the necessary depth of understanding and ownership of our digital
channels to act as an "intelligent client”. This makes services less
efficient and less effective for users.

There are also weaknesses in the consistency, timeliness, accuracy and
scope of management information to measure performance and costs between
different services and channels. This means we may miss opportunities to
target areas of waste, identify improvement opportunities or measure the
benefits of change.
